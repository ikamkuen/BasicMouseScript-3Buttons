# BasicMouseScript-3Buttons
AutoHotKey script for augmenting 3-button mice with everyday-use functions

## Introduction
This is an AutoHotkey script designed to bind 10 extra functions like copy and paste onto 3-button mice. By using this script, you can use these functions without using your other hand to press the keyboard buttons, or moving your mouse to select items on the right-click menu.

While X-Mouse Button Control also provides similar customization with a more user-friendly user interface, it doesn't allow you to use a button's original function after you set it as a modifier button. For example, if you set your forward button as a modifier button for a function layer, you cannot press it to use the forward function anymore. With AutoHotkey, using a button as a modifer while preserving its original function is possible.

I have also made another version for 5-button mice, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ikamkuen/AdvancedMouseScript-5Buttons).

⚠️Caution: While using this script, fast continous clicking would not be achievable for middle and right button. This may cause inconvenience while using some games and applications, such as Minecraft.

## Requirements
- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed computer
- A 3-button mouse, which includes left button, right button and middle button

## Installation
### Use with AutoHotkey
After installing AutoHotkey on your computer, download the 3ButtonMouse.ahk file, and click it to run it.
### Use without AutoHotkey
Download the 3ButtonMouse.exe file and run it directly.
### Set it to run on boot
Having to click the script/executable file every time you eant to use it can be annoying. To avoid this, you can set the script/executable file to run upon boot. Detailed setup guide for Windows can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configure-startup-applications-in-windows-115a420a-0bff-4a6f-90e0-1934c844e473).

Hint: You can put shortcuts instead of the file itself into the startup folder

If you want to edit this script, open the script file with any text editor, such as Notepad or Notepad++, and edit as you like.
